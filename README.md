# AI-HARA
This page contains supplementary materials for the paper "Using Operational Design Domain in Hazard Identification for Automated Systems" (Guillaume O. et al., 2022) (DOI not available for now). We present here the different resources available in this repository.

## Video Demonstration
The file "Demonstration_Video.mp4" is a video that presents the different functionalities planned to be implemented in the tool.

## User Interface Mockup
The GUI mockup is available here: https://codepen.io/PuppetMaster_/full/bGYpNXp . It contains the source code used for the demonstration video. For now, the complete tool is not implemented. Then only the user story presented in the video is guaranteed to run.

## FMEA Tables
The file "hazard_identification_tables.xlsx" contains one sheet for each tabular view presented in the paper (Maneuver-based Faults, Functional Insufficiencies, Component Limitations, Misuse Scenarios, and Environmental Triggering Conditions). These sheets contain in the first column the keywords of the table and in the following columns the elements specific to their category (e.g., the necessary components in the table "Component Limitations"). These sheets also contain the table header and a filled row example. 

## Ontology Metamodel
The UML profile of the UFO-based ontology metamodel with tiny model examples will be available soon in a separated project.

## Domain Specific Languages
The details on DSL for OC exceptions and logical scenarios will also be available soon.
